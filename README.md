# Real-Time-Alert-Mechanism-System
Synopsis
A.	Use Case
The main purpose of the real-time weather monitoring and alerting system is to ensure users receive timely and accurate weather information to help them prepare for extreme weather conditions like storms, heatwaves, or heavy rainfall.
Detailed Use Case Breakdown:
•	Real-time Weather Monitoring:
  o	Weather data (e.g., temperature, humidity, pressure, rainfall) is collected at frequent intervals from OpenWeatherMap API.
  o	The data is continuously updated to provide a live feed of weather conditions to the system.
  o	The system can adapt to the user’s location, providing weather data specific to that region.
•	Alerts for Extreme Conditions:
  o	When specific weather thresholds are breached (e.g., temperature > 35°C, 100mm of rain in an hour), alerts are triggered.
  o	Alerts are sent in real-time to users via Telegram.
  o	Notifications contain information about the severity of the weather, what actions to take, and safety tips.
•	Data Visualization:
  o	The weather data is aggregated and displayed on Apache Superset dashboards.
  o	Visualizations include graphs, heat maps, and alerts indicating extreme weather events.
  o	Real-time visual updates help users monitor trends and conditions on an ongoing basis.

B.	Problem Statement
Weather alerts are often generalized and delayed, failing to cater to individual regions and the timing required to take action. The problem can be broken down into:
1.	Delayed Alerts:
   o	Alerts may arrive too late for users to act accordingly, especially in situations like thunderstorms or extreme heat. For instance, a storm warning might be issued after the storm has already impacted the 
     area.
2.	Lack of Personalization:
   o	Current weather systems often deliver broad alerts that might not be region-specific or suitable for the user's actual location. For example, an alert for heavy rain might be irrelevant for users living in 
     an area that does not experience precipitation.
3.	Challenges in Data Processing and Visualization:
   o	Aggregating, processing, and visualizing live weather data in a format that is both user-friendly and actionable is complex. Storing and analyzing this large volume of data in real-time is another challenge 
     that must be addressed.

C.	Approach to Build the Real-Time Analytics Application
The application will utilize modern technologies to solve these problems:
1.	Data Collection:
    o	The OpenWeatherMap API will be used to fetch live weather data. API calls will be made at regular intervals to capture the latest data, with detailed weather parameters (temperature, humidity, etc.).
2.	Kafka for Real-Time Data Streaming:
    o	Kafka acts as the backbone for real-time data ingestion and processing.
	    Kafka Producer: A Python script will pull data from OpenWeatherMap and send it to Kafka topics for real-time processing.
	    Kafka Consumer: Another Python script will listen for data from Kafka, process it (extract weather data), and forward it to PostgreSQL for storage.

3.	PostgreSQL for Data Storage:
    o	Weather data will be stored in a PostgreSQL database, enabling efficient querying, analytics, and history tracking. The database schema will be designed to hold large volumes of weather data.
4.	Alerting System via Telegram:
    o	A Telegram bot will listen for specific triggers (e.g., extreme temperature or precipitation) and send instant alerts to subscribed users.
5.	Data Visualization via Apache Superset:
    o	Apache Superset will be used to build interactive dashboards for visualizing weather trends and conditions. This enables easy monitoring of data over time.

Project Plan
Phase 1: Initial Setup and Planning
1.	Research & Requirements Gathering:
    o	Thoroughly review the OpenWeatherMap API documentation to understand the data structure and possible limits (e.g., how frequently API calls can be made).
    o	Understand the thresholds for triggering alerts based on different weather conditions like temperature, wind speed, and rainfall.
2.	Tool & Technology Selection:
    o	OpenWeatherMap API (weather data).
    o	Kafka (for real-time data streaming).
    o	PostgreSQL (for data storage).
    o	Telegram Bot API (for alerting).
    o	Apache Superset (for data visualization).
3.	Set Up Environment:
    o	Install and configure necessary software like Kafka, PostgreSQL, Superset, and required Python libraries (e.g., psycopg2, python-telegram-bot, kafka-python).
    o	Set up the necessary environment variables, API keys, and configuration files.
Phase 2: Data Collection and Ingestion
1.	Set Up Kafka Producer:
    o	Write the Kafka producer script (producer.py) that will:
      Fetch data from OpenWeatherMap API.
      Parse the JSON response from OpenWeatherMap and extract relevant weather data.
	    Send the parsed data to Kafka as messages to a topic (e.g., weather_data).
2.	Set Up Kafka Consumer:
    o	Write the Kafka consumer script (consumer.py) that will:
	    Consume data from the weather_data Kafka topic.
	    Extract useful data fields (e.g., city, temperature, humidity).
	    Store the data in the PostgreSQL database.
3.	Create Database Schema:
    o	Create a weather_data table in PostgreSQL with the following columns:
    o	Implement logic in the Kafka consumer to insert processed data into this table.


Phase 3: Alert System
1.	Set Up Telegram Bot:
    o	Create a Telegram bot using BotFather on Telegram.
    o	Retrieve the bot token and configure the bot in a Python script (weather_alert_bot.py).
    o	Implement logic to send alerts when certain thresholds are met (e.g., temperature > 35°C).
    o	Define user groups or lists to subscribe users and send them location-specific alerts.

Phase 4: Data Presentation
1.	Install Apache Superset:
    o	Set up Apache Superset and configure it to connect to PostgreSQL.
    o	Install required dependencies using:
                                          pip install apache-superset
    o	Create a database connection in Superset to pull data from PostgreSQL.
2.	Create Dashboards:
    o	Build visualizations in Superset to display weather data, including charts for temperature, humidity, and extreme conditions.
    o	Create filters for users to focus on their specific region.
3.	Test and Refine:
    o	Run tests for each component (producer, consumer, alert system, and visualization).
    o	Refine the integration to ensure seamless data flow from OpenWeatherMap to Kafka to PostgreSQL and finally to Superset and Telegram bot.
